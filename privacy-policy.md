**Last updated:** October 27, 2025  
**Contact:** denaldicok@gmail.com

## 1) Who we are
JS Video Editor is a photo & video editing application. In this policy, when we say “we” or “our”, we mean the developers of JS Video Editor.

## 2) What data we collect
We **do not collect, store, or share any personal data** from users.

- No account or sign-in.
- No analytics, crash reporting, or tracking SDKs.
- No advertising and no advertising IDs.
- No server-side processing: all features work *offline/on-device*.

## 3) How your content is handled
Photos, videos, audio, and edits stay on your device. We do not upload your content to any server.

## 4) Permissions we request (why we need them)
- `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES / READ_MEDIA_VIDEO / READ_MEDIA_AUDIO` – lets you select images, videos, and audio from your device to edit/export on newer Android versions. Used only to read files you choose; not collected or uploaded.
- `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` *(Android 10 and below)* – used on older Android versions for the same purpose as the media permissions above: to let you browse and select your own photos, videos, and audio for editing and export. We only read the files you choose inside the app and never upload or collect them.
- `WAKE_LOCK` – keeps the device awake during long exports so the process doesn’t fail.

We access these permissions only to provide the editing features, and only while you use the related functions.

## 5) Children & age
The App is suitable for **all ages**. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children.

## 6) Data sharing
We **do not share** data with third parties.

## 7) Security
Because we do not collect or transmit personal data, there is no server-side storage. Your media stays on your device under your control.

## 8) Your choices
You can revoke app permissions at any time in your device settings. Revoking media permissions will limit features that need access to your files.

## 9) Changes to this policy
If we make material changes, we will update this page and the “Last updated” date above. If future versions add online services or data collection, this policy and our Google Play Data Safety form will be updated before release.
